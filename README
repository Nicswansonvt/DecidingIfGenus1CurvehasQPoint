This is the code accompaning my Master's Thesis linked here: https://hdl.handle.net/10919/119085

The only code here that has been tested is the code in the LocallySoluble file which contains a bunch of MAGMA functions to determine Local Solubility of an arbitrary genus one curve. The other files are unfinished
The main function here is the IsLocallySoluble() function:
/*
    Input: A Crv C defined over Q.
    Output: true if C(Qp) has a point for all padic numbers. false otherwise.
*/
The algorithm requires factoring a number that is incredibly large even for small examples, so a thourough runtime analysis has not been done.
In practice, this algorithm should almost never be used.
There is a function already in MAGMA by the same name (https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/text/1540#17797), that runs at least exponentially quicker; however, the input to this function is a not a Crv object but instead a ModelG1 object.
These ModelG1 objects were created for the purpose of performing decent on elliptic curves, and are used to perform 2, 3, and 5 decent (https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/text/1534).
Only a small porportion of genus one curves have an associated ModelG1 object, and the purpose of the algorithm written here is to provide a naive algorithm that does not require the ModelG1 object.
